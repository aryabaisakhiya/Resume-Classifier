# Resume Classification using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression

This project focuses on classifying resumes into specific job categories using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It utilizes **TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)** for feature extraction and **Logistic Regression** for classification.

## Overview

Recruiters often need to sort through numerous resumes to find suitable candidates for various roles. Manually categorizing resumes is time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. This project automates that process using a machine learning model trained on categorized resumes.

Key steps:

* Text preprocessing
* Feature extraction using TF-IDF
* Classification using Logistic Regression
* Model evaluation and performance metrics

---

## Dataset

The dataset contains resumes labeled with job categories such as:

* Data Science
* Human Resources
* Sales
* Marketing
* Design
* Others

If the dataset is not included in the repository, you can download a suitable public dataset or use your own.

---

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas
* NumPy
* NLTK or SpaCy (for optional preprocessing)
* Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE

---

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/resume-classification.git
   cd resume-classification
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## How to Use

1. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Resume_Classification.ipynb
   ```

   Or run the Python script:

   ```bash
   python resume_classifier.py
   ```

2. To classify a new resume (optional feature):

   ```python
   classify_resume("path_to_resume.txt")
   ```

## Results

Sample performance on a test dataset:

| Metric    | Score                  |
| --------- | ---------------------- |
| Accuracy  | 90% (approx.)          |
| Precision | High for major classes |
| Recall    | Good overall           |

A full classification report and confusion matrix are included in the notebook.
